# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal with the Jenky project is to further my learning and enhance my skills in game development using Unreal Engine 5.

Jenky is a... jenky game where players grab peices and stack them on top of each other to build a tower. The game is over when the tower falls over. The game is inspired by the popular mobile game Jenga.

The purpose of developing this software is to learn more about game development, improve my skills in Unreal Engine, and create an engaging and entertaining game that players can enjoy.

To see a demonstration of the game and a walkthrough of the code, you can watch the [Software Demo Video](https://youtu.be/dWRdxrRTwTg), which provides a 3 minute overview of the gameplay and highlights the key features of the code implementation.

# Development Environment

For the development of the Jenky project, I utilized the following tools:

- Unreal Engine 5: A powerful game development engine that provides a wide range of features and tools for creating high-quality games.

The primary programming language used in this project is Unreal's Blueprint, a visual scripting language that allows developers to create gameplay elements and interactions without writing code.

# Useful Websites

Throughout the development process, I found the following websites to be helpful resources:

- [Unreal Engine Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com): The official documentation for Unreal Engine, providing comprehensive guides, tutorials, and reference materials.
- [Unreal Engine Forums](https://forums.unrealengine.com): A community-driven platform where developers can ask questions, share knowledge, and seek assistance from experienced Unreal Engine users.

# Future Work

While the Jenky project has reached a functional state, there are several areas that I plan to address in future iterations:

- Add multiplayer functionality to allow players to compete against each other in real-time.
- Add ability to rotate jenky pieces.
- Adjust physics to make it a bit easier to control the jenky pieces.
